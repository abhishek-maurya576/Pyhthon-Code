# Task: Arithmetic Operations

The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, `a` and `b`. Add code to print three lines where:

1. The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
2. The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (`a - b`).
3. The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

## Example

**Print the following:**

```
8
-2
15
```

## Input Format

The first line contains the first integer, `a`.
The second line contains the second integer, `b`.

## Constraints

(No specific constraints mentioned in the original prompt, so I'll leave this blank.  In a real problem, constraints like the range of input values would be specified.)

## Output Format

Print the three lines as explained above.

## Sample Input 0

```
3
2
```

## Sample Output 0

```
5
1
6
```
