### Projects

The `01_project` directory contains mini-projects demonstrating Python in practical scenarios:

- **01_mini_TODO_(Console-Based).PY** - A simple console-based TODO list manager
- **password_generator.py** - A customizable secure password generator
- **gemini_content_generator.py** - A tool that generates educational content using the Gemini API

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Required libraries:
  - NumPy (for array operations)
  - Requests (for API interactions)

### Running the Examples

To run any example, navigate to its directory and use:

```bash
python filename.py
```

### Running the Projects

The projects in the `01_project` directory can be executed directly:

```bash
# To run the TODO list application
python 01_mini_TODO_(Console-Based).PY

# To generate secure passwords
python password_generator.py

# To use the Gemini content generator
# (Requires a valid API key to be added to the script)
python gemini_content_generator.py
```

## Topics Covered

This collection covers:

- Basic Python syntax
- Variables and data types
- Control structures (if/else, loops)
- Data structures (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries)
- Functions and modules
- File handling
- NumPy for numerical computing
- Date and time operations
- API interactions
- Console-based applications
- And more advanced topics

## Files to Exclude from Version Control

The following files and directories should not be pushed to GitHub:

- `passwords.txt` - Contains sensitive password information
- `__pycache__/` - Python bytecode directories
- `.pyc` files - Compiled Python files
- Build directories and compiled code
- Log files (*.log)
- Temporary files
- API keys and other secrets
